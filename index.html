           <p>my name is jaspreet kaur. i am 29 years old.i am an indian.I am living in U.K since 2014. i did my graduatiion in india. I did bachelors in information technology. At the moment i am working in Lidl warehouse as a training mentor.Its been five years to me working in there.If i talk about sports i like to play badminton or we can say its my favourite sport but yes i am not a very good player indeed.I like to cook,dance,listen music and shopping or can say these are my hobbies.I love to cook different kind of dishes.My whole family is vegeterian so some times i try to convert non-veg dish to vegeterian dish. On weekends, I cook for my whole family. The happiness and satisfaction I get while cooking for my family is unlimited.</p>
                   <p>I, being a human, am a kind, loving, and caring human being. I belong to a middle-class family. My family is the real essence of my life .
I owe everything to my family, especially my parents, brothers, and my husband, who stood by me through thick and thin and supported me to achieve my goals. i am a mother of two daughters. one of my daughter is 7years old and another one is just 13 months old. They are my life.
I have always been energetic and lively, so I have no problem making new friends. I try to learn a lot about people, so in this way, I study their characters before I react. I know that I am not perfect and I never try to be, but one thing is true: I am who I am.I am a religious kind of person and i do believe in God.I also want to travel the whole world and learn about different cultures and traditions.</p>
                 <p>I know that not everyone who shakes hands with you is your true friend, and my biggest weakness is that I trust people instantly. Another weakness that I get emotional very quickly, sometimes i feel i am very soft-hearted. However, I am trying hard to overcome my habit.</p>
    <p>i want to become a successfull person in my life.  I always value hard work, dedication, and sincerity. These values have been taught to me by my family, and I will work hard to achieve my goals and get success.</p>
